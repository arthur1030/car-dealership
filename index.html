        <h2>Brief History of Cars</h2>
        <p>The history of cars traces back to the late 19th century when Karl Benz invented the first true automobile, the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, in 1885. Around the same time, other inventors, like Gottlieb Daimler, contributed to the development of motorized vehicles. In the early 20th century, Henry Ford revolutionized car production by introducing mass production with the Model T in 1908, making cars more affordable for the average person.

            As the automotive industry grew, various categories of cars emerged. Sports cars, known for performance and sleek design, became popular with brands like Ferrari and Porsche. Luxury cars, such as Rolls-Royce and Mercedes-Benz, offered comfort and prestige. The rise of SUVs and crossovers in the late 20th century introduced more rugged, spacious vehicles for families and adventure seekers. 
            
            Electric vehicles gained momentum in the 21st century, with companies like Tesla leading the way. Muscle cars, characterized by powerful engines and aggressive looks, became icons of American automotive culture, while compact and economy cars gained popularity for their affordability and fuel efficiency.
            
            Technological advancements continue to shape the future, with autonomous driving and electric powertrains becoming more prominent, signaling an exciting future for the automotive world.</p>
